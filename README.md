# gwas_spMF

The code in this repo initially came from my persional machine, uploaded 5/19/2021.
Inclues modifications to Yuan's sp_snMF method, including removing the non-negativity constraint, allowing for running in parallel, and with variations on what the first factor should be initialized to.
