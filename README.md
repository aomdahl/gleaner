# Sparse GWAS matrix factorization

The project is an extension of work by Yuan He [here](https://github.com/heyuan7676/ts_eQTLs) but customized for genome-wide association studies. In particular, this involves modifications to make the method more flexible to summary statistics from various sources across many different phenotypes.

This work is currently in development, but more updates coming soon!
