# Analysis performed in GLEANR manuscript
The directories here provide the primary code and documentation describing how the analyses in the manuscript were conducted. Each subdirectory contains an `*.md` file that describes the workflow for each in detail.

These include: 

1) `FinnGen_vs_UKBB_analysis`: scripts and commands for processing GWAS from the UKBB and from FinnGen and then performing GLEANR on both
2) `PanUKBB_analysis`: overviews the selection of traits, their download, pre-processing using the snakemake pipeline in this repo, GLEANR, and downstream evaluations
3) `simulations`: describes both types of simulations performed here and contains the code/references used to generate these
